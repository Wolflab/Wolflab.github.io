My research program centers around Plant evolutionary genomics. See the research projects tab and publication tab to see examples of recent research. I am currently seeking masters (Biological Sciences) and PhD (Biotechnology) level students to join my research group.

You can visit the UAH site for more details on the requirements of the programs and the application process, for masters students and for PhD students.

I have a strong record in mentoring students at all levels, and I am committed to providing a creative and challenging learning environment. Financial support is limited: some Graduate Teaching Assistantships are available on a competitive basis for students in the PhD Biotech Program and for those masters students working towards a thesis (Plan I). Please contact me directly if you are interested in working in my lab.
