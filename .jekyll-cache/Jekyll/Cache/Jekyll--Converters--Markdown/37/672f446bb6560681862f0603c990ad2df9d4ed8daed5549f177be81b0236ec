I"6<p>Ferns represent a major clade of plants for which there was, until very recently, no genome sequence available. For several years, our lab has been exploring genome space in several groups of ferns. This work is in collaboration with former student Josh Der, Kathleen Pryer and Fay-Wei Li, Blaine Marchant, Emily Sessa, Pam Soltis, Doug Soltis. We recently published genome sequences for two heterosporous ferns (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-018-0188-8">link</a>) and working on the much larger genome of the homosporous fern Ceratopteris.</p>
