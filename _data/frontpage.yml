title: Welcome to the Lab!
description: Research in my lab focuses on plant evolutionary biology, spanning population
  genetics to deep phylogeny. My main interest is in ferns (including Pteridium and
  Ceratopteris), but students in the lab are also working on flowering plants, including
  Eriogonum, Populus, Allenrolfea, Betula, and Boechera. The lab uses a wide array
  of tools, including next-generation genomic sequencing, RNA-seq, Rad-seq (GBS),
  single-gene Sanger sequencing, microsatellites, and AFLPs.
