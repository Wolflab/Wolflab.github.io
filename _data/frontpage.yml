title: Welcome to the Lab!
description: Research in my lab focuses on plant evolutionary biology, spanning population genetics to deep phylogeny. My main interest is in ferns (including Pteridium and Ceratopteris), but students in the lab are also working on flowering plants, including Eriogonum, Populus, Allenrolfea, Betula, and Boechera. The lab uses a wide array of tools, including next-generation genomic sequencing, RNA-seq, Rad-seq (GBS), single-gene Sanger sequencing, microsatellites, and AFLPs.
